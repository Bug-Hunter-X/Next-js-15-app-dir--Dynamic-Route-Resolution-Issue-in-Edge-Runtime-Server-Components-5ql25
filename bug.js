In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the new `app` directory and server components with edge runtime.  If you're fetching data within a server component using `fetch` or similar, and that data includes dynamic routes (e.g., `/products/[productId]`), the dynamic segment might not be correctly resolved in the edge runtime environment. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, particularly if the route segment is crucial for the data-fetching logic. The issue stems from a potential mismatch between how the router handles dynamic segments in the server component's context compared to the client-side routing.
